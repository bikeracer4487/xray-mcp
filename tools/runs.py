"""Test run management tools for Xray MCP server.

This module provides functionality for managing test runs in Xray.
Test runs represent the actual execution of a test within a test execution
context, tracking the results, evidence, and execution details.

Note:
    This module is currently a stub implementation. Full functionality
    will be implemented based on TESTRUN_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md.
