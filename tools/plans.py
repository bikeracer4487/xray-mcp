"""Test plan management tools for Xray MCP server.

This module provides functionality for managing test plans in Xray.
Test plans are used to organize and track testing activities for releases,
sprints, or specific features.

Note:
    This module is currently a stub implementation. Full functionality
    will be implemented based on TESTPLANS_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md.
