# Known Issues - Xray MCP Server

**Last Updated:** August 5, 2025  
**Testing Version:** Latest  
**Testing Project:** FRAMED  

This document catalogs known issues discovered during comprehensive testing of the Xray MCP Server's 48 tools. Issues are categorized by severity and component.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. GraphQL Schema Field Selection Error ✅ FIXED
**Affected Tools:** `get_test_set`, `get_test_sets`  
**Error:** `Field "jira" must not have a selection since type 'JSON' has no subfields`  
**Impact:** Cannot retrieve test set details or query test sets  
**Status:** RESOLVED (January 18, 2025)  
**Fix Applied:** Removed subfield selections from jira fields in GraphQL queries

**Technical Details:**
Fixed by removing the nested field selections `{ key, fields }` from jira field queries in `tools/testsets.py`. The jira field now correctly uses only the fields parameter without attempting to select subfields on the JSON type.

---

### 2. Missing Tool Implementation ✅ FIXED
**Affected Tools:** `create_test_run`  
**Error:** `'TestRunTools' object has no attribute 'create_test_run'`  
**Impact:** Cannot create test runs programmatically  
**Status:** RESOLVED (January 18, 2025)  
**Fix Applied:** Added complete `create_test_run` method implementation in `TestRunTools`

**Technical Details:**
Added the missing `create_test_run` method to the `TestRunTools` class in `tools/runs.py`. The implementation includes proper GraphQL mutation handling and graceful error handling for cases where the mutation may not be available in certain Xray versions.

---

### 3. GraphQL Mutation Not Available
**Affected Tools:** `create_test_version_from`  
**Error:** `Cannot query field 'createTestVersionFrom' on type 'Mutation'`  
**Impact:** Cannot create new test versions from existing versions  
**Status:** Unresolved  
**Workaround:** Manual version management through UI  

**Technical Details:**
The GraphQL schema doesn't include the `createTestVersionFrom` mutation that the tool attempts to use.

---

## High Priority Issues

### 4. Response Parsing Error ✅ FIXED
**Affected Tools:** `delete_test_set`  
**Error:** `'str' object has no attribute 'get'`  
**Impact:** Cannot delete test sets programmatically  
**Status:** RESOLVED (January 18, 2025)  
**Fix Applied:** Enhanced response parsing to handle both string and object responses

**Technical Details:**
Fixed the response parsing logic in `delete_test_set` method to properly handle both string responses and dictionary responses from the GraphQL API. The method now checks the response type and processes accordingly.

---

### 5. ID Resolution Inconsistency ✅ FIXED
**Affected Tools:** `add_tests_to_execution`, various delete operations  
**Error:** `Could not resolve Jira key FRAMED-XXXX to issue ID`  
**Impact:** Inconsistent behavior between operations using Jira keys vs numeric IDs  
**Status:** RESOLVED (January 18, 2025)  
**Fix Applied:** Enhanced IssueIdResolver with resource-type-specific fallback chains and caching

**Technical Details:**
Root cause identified: The original IssueIdResolver only used `getTests` query but was called for all resource types (test sets, executions, plans, etc.), causing systematic failures for non-test resources. 

**Fix Implementation:**
- Added ResourceType enum for resource classification
- Implemented fallback chain approach with 5 different GraphQL query methods:
  - `_try_tests()` - for Test resources
  - `_try_test_sets()` - for Test Set resources  
  - `_try_test_executions()` - for Test Execution resources
  - `_try_test_plans()` - for Test Plan resources
  - `_try_coverable_issues()` - for non-test issues (Stories, Tasks, Bugs)
- Added resource-type-specific optimization (tries most likely query first)
- Implemented in-memory caching for performance improvement
- Updated all tool classes to pass appropriate ResourceType hints
- Enhanced error handling and graceful fallback between methods

The resolver now systematically tries each appropriate query method until a match is found, eliminating the previous systematic failures for specific resource types.

## Medium Priority Issues

### 6. Complex Parameter Requirements ✅ FIXED
**Affected Tools:** `create_precondition`  
**Error:** GraphQL schema validation errors - "Unknown PreconditionTypeInput type"  
**Impact:** Cannot create preconditions programmatically  
**Status:** RESOLVED (August 13, 2025)  
**Fix Applied:** Updated mutation to use correct `UpdatePreconditionTypeInput` type  

**Technical Details:**
The mutation was using incorrect type `PreconditionTypeInput!` but the Xray GraphQL schema expects `UpdatePreconditionTypeInput`. Fixed in `tools/preconditions.py` by:
- Updated GraphQL mutation to use `UpdatePreconditionTypeInput` 
- Made `definition` and `preconditionType` optional as per schema
- Added type conversion logic for both string and object formats
- Preconditions now create successfully (tested with Generic and Manual types)

---

### 7. Permission Restrictions
**Affected Tools:** `get_folder_contents`  
**Error:** `User doesn't have permissions to view test repository`  
**Impact:** Cannot browse test folder structure programmatically  
**Status:** Configuration Issue  
**Workaround:** Request additional permissions or use manual folder navigation  

**Technical Details:**
The API user may lack sufficient permissions to access the test repository folder structure, or the project configuration restricts programmatic access.

---

## Low Priority Issues

### 8. Resource State Inconsistencies
**Affected Tools:** Various delete operations  
**Observation:** Some resources report "not found" immediately after creation  
**Impact:** Inconsistent resource lifecycle management  
**Status:** Intermittent  
**Workaround:** Add delay between create and delete operations  

**Technical Details:**
Some resources (like test plans) cannot be found for deletion immediately after creation, suggesting either async processing delays or caching issues.

---

### 9. Array Parameter Validation
**Affected Tools:** `create_test_execution`, `create_test_run`  
**Observation:** Array parameters may cause validation errors  
**Impact:** Reduced flexibility in bulk operations  
**Status:** Minor  
**Workaround:** Use individual operations instead of bulk arrays  

**Technical Details:**
Complex array parameters like `test_issue_ids` and `test_environments` sometimes trigger validation errors that aren't clearly explained.

---

## Testing Limitations

### Tools Not Fully Tested
- `upload_attachment` - Requires existing test steps with specific IDs
- `delete_attachment` - Requires existing attachments to delete
- ~~`update_precondition`~~ - Now working after precondition fix
- ~~`delete_precondition`~~ - Now working after precondition fix
- `remove_tests_from_set` - Blocked by get_test_set issues
- `update_test_set` - Blocked by get_test_set issues

### Environmental Factors
- **Permissions:** Testing limited by API user permissions in FRAMED project
- **Data Dependencies:** Some tools require specific pre-existing data structures
- **Rate Limiting:** Not encountered during testing but may affect bulk operations

## Workaround Summary

| Issue | Workaround | Effectiveness |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Test set retrieval | Use create/add operations only | High |
| Test run creation | Use test executions instead | High |
| Version creation | Manual UI operations | Medium |
| Test set deletion | Manual UI operations | Medium |
| ~~ID resolution~~ | ~~Use numeric IDs from create responses~~ | ~~High~~ ✅ **FIXED** |
| Precondition creation | Manual UI operations | Medium |
| Folder browsing | Manual navigation or external tools | Low |
